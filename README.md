# PowerCollections

I tried to do an SVN import of [http://powercollections.codeplex.com/](http://powercollections.codeplex.com/), but failed.

This is an updated version that *uses* NuGet for NUnit. The test cases were updated to use the `Assert.Throws<T>` instead of the `[ExpectedException("")]` attribute.

Nothing else was changed, nothing else is planned.
